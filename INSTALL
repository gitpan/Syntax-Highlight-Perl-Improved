
To install Syntax::Highlight::Perl on your system, as root:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you do not have root access, use the PREFIX argument (and,
optionally, INSTALLMAN3DIR for the man(1) pages) to Makefile.PL:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=[LIBDIR]
    make
    make install


Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved is Pure Perl and has no dependencies.
To install this  module  with  only  FTP  access, simply create
the appropriate subdirectory, Syntax/Highlight/Perl, under whatever
directory you are using for  Perl  libraries (you will probably
have to `use lib' that directory in your script) and upload the
module (Improved.pm) into that directory.
